\section{Study of real-world throttling bugs}

We define a throttling bug as a bug that causes either too many
or too few requests to enter a server, which causes a temporary
crash or slowdown of the server. 

Throttling bug may overlap with the following types of bugs and
we try to make a distinction. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Performance bug.

\item Memory leak.

\item Lock contention.

\end{itemize}



We studied the bug reports of X applications, including Cassandra, Hadoop Common, HBase, HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, Ignite, Kafka, Storm and Spark.
We searched keywords including ``throttling'', ``blocking'', ``rate limit'', ``out of memory'', etc.
